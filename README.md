# TI-Spirograph
A spirograph program painstakingly typed out on a TI-84 calculator and written in TI-BASIC. I get bored in math a lot ðŸ˜‚

## How to copy
The program is typed out in a `.txt` file for readability, but copying the `.8xp` file to your calculator will put it on your calculator.

## How to run
You'll need to set the zoom settings before first running. See below for how to do that. Once you've done that, however, you can run the program. You'll be prompted to enter angular velocities like so:

```
A1 SPEED:
A2 SPEED:
```

These control how fast the arms move, and these are the only adjustable parameters for now (I really didn't spend too much time on this)

## Setting the zoom settings
After copying to a calculator, you need to store the following zoom settings before running:

```
Xmin=-48
Xmax=48
Ymin=-32
Ymax=32
```

After changing these settings from the default, press `ZOOM`, arrow over, and select `ZoomSto` to save it.

You can leave the other settings at their default values. These values will essentially just set the screen so that one space on the coordinate plane is equal to one pixel on the screen. I thought this might make images clearer, but if I rewrote it this might not be necessary.
